        <div class="accordion-content" style="background-color: #F2F2F2;">

            Can I use AI?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content" style="background-color: #F2F2F2;">
            <p>In alignment with DAPA's policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), students with Language, Literacy, and Numeracy (LLND) needs may be supported to use approved AI tools as learning aids. These tools can assist with summarising complex texts, generating study questions, supporting grammar and writing clarity, and brainstorming ideas. When permitted, you must acknowledge how AI was used and demonstrate your own understanding in submitted work. AI should be used to support learning, not to replace student thinking or authentic assessment. DAPA provides guidance on the ethical and responsible use of AI.</p>

            <p>Students may defer their training for up to 12 months by completing the appropriate Suspension of Training Form. Fees associated with deferral will be communicated.

Students will be informed if any course content or delivery changes occur during this time.</p>
            <p>You can also request a temporary suspension in cases of long-term absence or inability to continue, with similar conditions to deferral.</p>

            Can I get recognition for my prior learning (RPL)?
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content" style="background-color: #F2F2F2;">
            <p>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process that recognises a student for formal and non-formal training and life/work experience. You will discuss RPL and credit transfer opportunities during the pre-enrolment induction. Evidence that can be used to support an application can include a detailed resume or letters from employers, an interview with the Assessor, work skills/knowledge, attendance to professional development courses, and paid or unpaid work experience. Course recognition will be granted if you provide sufficient evidence of relevant prior learning or experience.</p>
            <p>Credit Transfer (CT) is also available for units of competency and modules completed through a different RTO, evidenced by an Academic or USI Transcript.</p>
